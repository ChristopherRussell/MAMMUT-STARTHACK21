# START Hack 2021 - Mammut Case - Team BClimb

We provide a jupyer notebook script which takes sensor data and creates various overlays for your climbing video that matches the data. In order to use you will need to specify the timestamp of the video where the data readings start. The overlay consists of:
- A live-growing graph of your total climbed height;
- Live data in text form regarding your total hand moves, and time holding with each hand;
- A visualisation of the magnitude of the 3d-acceleration reading from each hand (it was difficult for us to sync this data with the video for our demo, as it's not clear when the climb starts.)
